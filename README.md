# Music Player Demo

I was offered a chance to interview for a freelance project that was asking to build a conceptually similar app. Unfortunately, I was busy with a previous client and I wasn't able to get the head start that another developer was so they won this contract, but I was really intrigued by the idea. Because of that I decided to take the music player concept, target a different audience with different functionality and go with a completely different UI as a demo for future clients.

## Goals
> _keep in mind, this is meant to be a demo and will likely never make it to production._

- User's have ability to create playlists and share these playlists with other users.
- Playlists can accept _'likes'_ and track popularity by how often they are played.
- Stand-alone PWA functionality with full offline support.
